## QUESTIONS

- Should i split each kind of realm in separate gno module ? (/r/launchpad_grc20/factory/..., /r/launchpad_gr20/airdrop/..., .../sales/...) 
- Why i can't use pkg like `/p/demo/merkle` w/ gnodev ? (i guess it's bc gnodev did not connect to the chain but how can i overcome this ? copy paste the pkg ?)
- Is there fee on Aidrop ?
